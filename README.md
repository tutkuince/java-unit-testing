**Unit testing** involves the testing of each unit or an individual component of the software application.
The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected
**Unit** may be an individiual function, method, procedure, module and object

Integration tests focus on integrating different layers of the application. That also means no mocking is involved.
Basically, we write integration tests for testing a feature which may involve interaction with multiple components.
